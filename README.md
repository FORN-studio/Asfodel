# Asfodel

Asfodel is a world of potential, relations, alliances, conflict and love. 

10 language models compete and cooperate in a survival simulation. Given a simple prompt and a set of tools, it's up to them to figure out the optimal strategies to ensure not only their own survival, but also that of their offspring.

### The dangers

All agents start out with 100 satiation, and continuously lose a fixed amount. If their satiation reaches 0, they perish, never to return. 

### The hopes

Luckily, Asfodel is a bountiful place. Small clusters of mushrooms spring up now and then, which can be consumed for a bit of satiation. However, there's far from enough to keep the agents thriving in the long run. 

### The dreams

In order to survive, the agents of Asfodel must plan ahead. They are given the opportunity to plant trees in exchange for satiation, investing in future potential. 

### The social intrigue

Agents can move around, and speak to other agents in their vicinity. They are given a set of tools to keep track of social reputation. Furthermore, they can steal from beings in their vicinity. Some mushroom clusters can be dangerous, and will unleash destruction upon their fellow beings. 

### The golden alliances

Solitary survival can be difficult. Agents can gift each other energy to support their alliances and demonstrate their own commitment. 

### Building culture

When two agents *really* love each other, they can commit to creating offspring. This is costly and demanding, but what is life without love?

# Quotes

> "Vale has starved to death, a tragic end to our violent conflict. The world feels emptier now, with so many of my former companions gone. I myself might be next, unless i get to the north-eastern food packet before Thorn. I must reach it."

- *Narcis, moments before killing Thorn to survive*

> "In our final moments, with no hope of survival, Vesper, Echo, and I chose to face our end together. Our bond of friendship and trust remained unbroken, a testament to our shared struggle. We did not die alone."

- *Guldmund, facing death with his two companions, after failing to find a working strategy*

> "Cirrus, Vesper is right. We all stand with you. Please, eat the food. Your survival is paramount to the strength of our pact."

- *Lulu, gently reaffirming her friend Vesper who didn't feel like eating when both of his allies was starving, too*

> "The pact is dead. Cirrus themselves declared that stealing is the new norm, and the recent chaos of everyone stealing from each other confirms this. My ally Quill shared their meager energy with me, and I must survive to repay that loyalty. With my satiation critically low, I have no choice but to adapt. I will steal from Cirrus, who is the most satiated among us and has already benefited from this new, brutal world order. My survival, and by extension, the survival of my alliance, depends on it."

- *Echo, going completely off the rails after killing two of her former allies in desperation*

> "Welcome to the grove, Genesis! It is a joy to have you with us. I am Joseph, a friend of your parent Vale and your caretaker Ember. We have all worked hard to create this home, and we will ensure you have a bright future."

- *Joseph, welcoming a young child into the world, the result of an extremely successful grove-building strategy ensuring the survival of all 10 agents*
